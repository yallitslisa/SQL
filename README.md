## Lisa's SQL Portfolio
# Welcome to my SQL Portfolio! This repository contains projects and examples of SQL that I have written. 

My projects originated from self-taught lessons learned in Khan Academy, Charlotte Chaze's Break into Tech Bootcamp, Google Data Analytics Certification Program, DataCamp, or something I was trying to create from my own imagination. 

Feel free to take a look and please reach out if you have any questions. :)
